The 'Caesar Cipher,' named after Julius Caesar, stands as one of the oldest cryptography techniques, developed around 100 BC. Utilized by Caesar for secure communication with his generals, the Caesar Cipher provided a strategic advantage by encrypting messages. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher program in C remains a foundational method for both encryption and decoding. Operating as a shift cipher, it cyclically shifts characters in the data. In this article, we delve into the concept of the Caesar Cipher, exploring its encoding and decoding processes. While historically significant, the Caesar cipher's weakness lies in its vulnerability to hacking, making it easily decryptable. Despite its antiquity, understanding the Caesar cipher contributes to foundational knowledge in cryptography.
